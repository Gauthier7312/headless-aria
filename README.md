# Headless-aria

React Aria headless components

This package based on React Aria is to help me building rapidly a design system because I don't want to try to relearn each time how to use react-aria hooks so build headless components like reach-ui or headless ui would makes things more productive.

## Useful commands

```bash
npx lerna add <dependency> --scope=package
```

Add a new package

```bash
npx lerna create <package>
```

NB: You can get more information on the command with the flag `--help`
